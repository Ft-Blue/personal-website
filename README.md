## Personal Website ðŸš¢
This project is both my portfolio website (you can visit it [here](moadfethallah.com)) and a side project. 
It's a fun project I use to implement some of the things I learned along the way in my software engineering career.

## Getting started
1. Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
2. Setup Contentful variables in `.env` ([an extended guide](https://blog.theodo.com/2024/05/integrate-contentful-nextjs) on setting up Contentful with Next.js)
```
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=<SPACE_ID>
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<ACCESS_TOKEN>
CONTENTFUL_CMA_TOKEN=<CMA_TOKEN>
```
3. Start the server
```bash
make dev
# OR
npm run dev
```

## What I used
- VSCode for all the extensions it provides
- Vercel for easy hosting and deployment
- My base [Next.js template](https://github.com/Ft-Blue/nextjs-template-app) to get started quickly
- Next.js for generating a site statically
- Tailwind for lightning fast styling
- Contentful for content management
- Fontawesome for icons
- [Brittany's portfolio](brittanychiang.com) for inspiration
